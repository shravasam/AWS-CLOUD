ETL workflow-Rdbms,oracle,sql server etc (extract) --> staging(Transform) -->Data warehousing(Load)
Advantages of data warehouse --> combined view of data 
AWS Glue Crawlwers ---> 
5 major componets :
   
    1) Glue Data catalog
    2) Glue crawlers : Connects to data source (s3, Dydb) to scan data and creates metadata tables in Glue Data Catalog.
                       Can scan multiple data sources in single run
                       once completed, it will create table in data catalog
                       this table can be used in Athena, ETL jobs, Redshifts spectrum
    3) ETL Engine : generates python /scala code
    4) Glue Triggers : jobs
    5) Glue workflow : different steps of glue crawlers
How crawler work :
      1) classifies data to determine the format, schema and associated properties of the raw data
      2) Groups data into tables (or partitions if data is partitiones )
      3) writes metadata to the data catalog
      
      Types of classifiers
               Built in claffifier-- json
               custom classifier
